# contrast-enhancement-for-rice-plant-images
Implementation of histogram equalization for contrast enhancement of rice plant images using Python and OpenCV.

## Overview
This project implements histogram equalization to enhance image contrast
using Python and OpenCV.

## Objective
To improve visibility of image features by redistributing pixel intensity.

## Method
1. Convert image to grayscale
2. Apply histogram equalization
3. Compare original vs enhanced image

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
